# - Find OpenSG 1.8 libraries
# Find the specified OpenSG 1.8 libraries and header files. Slightly modified
# from the version for 2.0, see # 1.8 - comments
#
# Since OpenSG consists of a number of libraries you need to specify which
# of those you want to use. To do so, pass a list of their names after
# the COMPONENTS argument to FIND_PACKAGE. A typical call looks like this:
# FIND_PACKAGE(OpenSG REQUIRED COMPONENTS OSGBase OSGSystem OSGDrawable)
#
# This module specifies the following variables:
#  OpenSG_INCLUDE_DIRS
#  OpenSG_LIBRARIES
#  OpenSG_LIBRARY_DIRS
#
#  For each component COMP the capitalized name (e.g. OSGBASE, OSGSYSTEM):
#  OpenSG_${COMP}_LIBRARY
#  OpenSG_${COMP}_LIBRARY_RELEASE
#  OpenSG_${COMP}_LIBRARY_DEBUG
#
#  You can control where this module attempts to locate libraries and headers:
#  you can use the following input variables:
#  OPENSG_ROOT          root of an installed OpenSG with include/OpenSG and lib below it
#  OPENSG_INCLUDE_DIR   header directory
#  OPENSG_LIBRARY_DIR   library directory
#  OR
#  OPENSG_INCLUDE_SEARCH_DIR
#  OPENSG_LIBRARY_SEARCH_DIR

# This macro sets the include path and libraries to link to.
# On Windows this also sets some preprocessor definitions and disables some warnings.
